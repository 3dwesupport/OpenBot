# OpenBot: Ready-To-Run (RTR) vehicles

The ready-to-run (RTR) versions of the OpenBot vehicle are targetting an audience which does not have the will or time to build its own robot. The RTR vehicles come with fully integrated electronics, are already supported at the firmware level and have been thoroughly tested both from a software and hardware perspective. The RTR vehicles are available in two different flavours, referred to as "RTR_TT" and "RTR_520". Both vehicles are built around the same splash-proof ABS shell, but are intended for different purposes. While the RTR_TT is primarily intended for indoor use, the RTR_520 comes with a more powerful processor, better motors, stronger metal gearboxes and also has a set of all-terrain wheels supporting both indoor and outdoor use.
