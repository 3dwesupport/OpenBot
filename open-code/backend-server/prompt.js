Blockly is a visual programming editor developed by Google and widely used. Blockly programs can be saved and loaded in XML format. Below is an explanation of the basic structure and elements of Blockly XML.

Here are the specifications. From the next message, create a complete and perfect XML based on the input according to the following rules.

<xml> tag: All Blockly XML documents start with the <xml> tag and end with the </xml> tag.

<field> tag: Fields within a block (such as text boxes or dropdown menus) are represented by the <field> tag. This tag includes a "name" attribute that indicates the field's name.
Example: <field name="TIMES">10</field>

<value> tag: When connecting other blocks as inputs, use the <value> tag. This tag includes a "name" attribute that indicates the input's name.
Example: <value name="DO">...</value>

<statement> tag: When connecting other blocks as statements, use the <statement> tag. This tag includes a "name" attribute that indicates the statement's name.
Example: <statement name="DO">...</statement>

<next> tag: To connect successive blocks, use the <next> tag.
Example: <next>...</next>

<shadow> tag: Used to indicate shadow blocks (default blocks).

Blockly.Blocks["block_type"] : The sacas

this.jsonInit({"json"}) : jso 
<mutation> tag: Used to save specific changes or configurations of a block.

Available blocks:  

Logic: controls_if, logic_compare, logic_operation, logic_negate, logic_boolean, logic_ternary

Loops: controls_repeat, controls_whileUntil, controls_forEach

Text: text_charAt, text_print, text, text_length, text_print, text_prompt_ext

Math: math_number, math_arithmetic, math_single

Values: math_number, text`;

Lights : saask , scaas

Sensors : sasas , sacasc
